    * corner cases
        * null
        * empty
    * regular cases
        * convey your thoughts and explain how you are gonna solve the problem
        * excellent communications at this stage
        * Don't ignore the interviewer
* Brainstorming about the data structure and Algorithm
    * convey your thoughts and explain how you are gonna solve the problem for a general case
    * excellent communications at this stage
    * Don't ignore the interviewer
    * Talk while you are doing the brainstorming 
* Runtime Analysis
    * time big-O and space big-O
* Coding
    * blah, blah while you are coding, but don't do it too much, it could be annoying 
    * some words:

### What next? 

As you have probably figured out by now, one of the best ways to learn something is to practice it. 
With interviewing, it’s great that you’ve worked through solutions on your own, but that’s 
not quite what you need to prepare for an interview. Today you‘ll be able to schedule a live mock interview and be one step closer to a job you love. 

Practice Interviewing with Pramp 

Pramp is a peer-to-peer mock interview platform for coding interviews, focused on questions regarding algorithms and data structures. 
It pairs software developers together for a practice interview, based on their background, availability and practicing needs. 
Pramp automates the whole process and takes care of scheduling, peer matching and interview prep content (i.e. interview questions and answers). A live practice session includes integrated HD video chat, collaborative code, and support for 17 different programming languages.
