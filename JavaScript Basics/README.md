## Lesson 3

#### Truthy and Falsy Values

*   false
*   0 (zero)
*   "" (empty string)
*   null
*   undefined
*   NaN

All other values are truthy, including "0" (zero in quotes), "false" (false in quotes), empty functions, empty arrays, and empty objects.

```JavaScript
var a = !!(0); // variable is set to false
var b = !!("0"); // true
```


#### Comparing Falsy Values

Falsy values follow some slightly odd comparison rules which can lead to errors in program logic.

The falsy values false, 0 (zero), and "" (empty string) are all equivalent and can be compared against each other:

```JavaScript

var c = (false == 0); // true
var d = (false == ""); // true
var e = (0 == ""); // true
```

The falsy values null and undefined are not equivalent to anything except themselves:

```JavaScript

var f = (null == false); // false
var g = (null == null); // true
var h = (undefined == undefined); // true
var i = (undefined == null); // true

```

Finally, the falsy value NaN is not equivalent to anything â€” including NaN!

```JavaScript

var j = (NaN == null); // false
var k = (NaN == NaN); // false

```

You should also be aware that typeof(NaN) returns "number". Fortunately, the core JavaScript function isNaN() can be used to evaluate whether a value is NaN or not.

## Lesson 4
### Hidden values using DOM

If the resume you're building doesn't have data in a certain section, like Education, the empty section is automatically hidden. At the bottom of index.html, you'll find a few lines of JavaScript that follow this pattern:
```JavaScript
if (document.getElementsByClassName("education-entry").length === 0) {
    document.getElementById("education").style.display = "none";
}
```

### Remove "<" and ">" from code
```JavaScript
var charEscape = function(_html) {
    var newHTML = _html;

    newHTML = _html.replace(/</g, "&lt;");
    newHTML = newHTML.replace(/>/g, "&gt;");

    return newHTML;
};
```

There are a few ways to remove < and > from code. The simplest is simply replacing them with their character entity references (\&lt; and \&gt;).

To do so, we can use string.replace(old, new). Note, however, that if you pass in a string as old, string.replace(old, new) will only replace the first instance of the old string.

You must pass in a regular expression as old to replace every instance of old in the string.

In the example above, we passed /</g and />/g as old into string.replace(old, new), which are regular expressions that grab all instances of < and >.

### Dot Notation Vs Bracket Notation

**Bracket notation always works**. Dot notation requires properties that begin
with a letter and do not include special characters.

Let's go through these one-by-one.

>"property"

**dot notation**: true

**bracket notation**: true

This one is normal. Either syntax is fine.

>"property1"

**dot notation**: true

**bracket notation**: true

A number attached to the end of a property is acceptable for dot and bracket notation.

>"property-2"

**dot notation**: false

**bracket notation**: true

Some special characters like the - are not acceptable with dot notation but will still work with bracket notation.

>"property 3"

**dot notation**: false

**bracket notation**: true

Spaces are generally bad form in programming. Don't use them except within strings. But you can still access a property name with a space using bracket notation.

>"property$"

**dot notation**: true

**bracket notation**: true

Surprisingly, you actually can use $ within property names and still access them with dot notation.

>" property"

**dot notation**: false

**bracket notation**: true

In dot notation, the space actually gets ignored, so you are accessing "property" instead. But bracket notation still works.

>"property()"

**dot notation**: false

**bracket notation**: true

Without quotes, property() is a function call. This is just plain bad. While you can access a property like this one with bracket notation, there's no reason you should ever include () within an object property.

>"property[]"

**dot notation**: false

**bracket notation**: true

Like the last one, this is bad form too. [] already have a specific purpose in JavaScript and should never be used within a property.

>"8property"

**dot notation**: false

**bracket notation**: true

Dot notation fails to work if the property starts with a number. This is also bad form. Properties should never start with numbers.


## Lesson 5

### For-In Loops

Clarification

Use forEach or for to iterate over arrays like:

    countries = ['Argentina', 'China', 'England'];

Use for-in to loop over objects like:

    countries = {'country1':'Argentina', 'country2':'China','country3':'England'};

being careful to wrap the content of the for-in in a conditional statement that tests if the key is part of the object:

```JavaScript
myObj = {'country1':'Germany', 'country2':'Argentina'};
for (key in myObj){
    if (myObj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        console.log(myObj[key]);
    }
}
```

### jQury (:last)

The :last jQuery selector returns the final element in a list that matches
whatever precedes it. So for work-entry:last, if there are 3 work-entry
elements, it will only return the 3rd one. Example:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("p:last").css("background-color", "yellow");
});
</script>
</head>
<body>

<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the last paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

### Collecting Click Locations

```JavaScript
$(document).click(function(loc) {
    var x = loc.pageX;
    var y = loc.pageY;

    logClicks(x, y);
});
```

##### $(document).click()
$(document).click() is a jQuery event handler on the page, which is a fancy way of saying that it will hold some code that runs every time a user clicks on the page. The function (that doesn't have a name, making it an anonymous function) that gets passed into .click() will be run every time a user clicks on the page.

##### loc
loc is a jQuery event object that contains information about the click event. Learn about event's properties with jQuery's documentation.

### Return Statements

```JavaScript
var work = {
  "jobs": [
    {
      "employer": "Udacity",
      "title": "Course Developer",
      "location": "Mountain View, CA",
      "dates": "Feb 2014 - Current",
      "description": "Who moved my cheese cheesy feet cauliflower cheese. Queso taleggio when the cheese comes out everybody's happy airedale ricotta cheese and wine paneer camembert de normandie.

    },
    {
      "employer": "LearnBIG",
      "title": "Software Engineer",
      "location": "Seattle, WA",
      "dates": "May 2013 - Jan 2014",
      "description": "Who moved my cheese cheesy feet cauliflower cheese. Queso taleggio when the cheese comes out everybody's happy airedale ricotta cheese and wine paneer camembert de normandie.

    },
    {
      "employer": "LEAD Academy Charter High School",

      "dates": "Jul 2012 - May 2013",
      "description": "Who moved my cheese cheesy feet cauliflower cheese. Queso taleggio when the cheese comes out everybody's happy airedale ricotta cheese and wine paneer camembert de normandie.

    },
    {
      "employer": "Stratford High School",
      "title": "Science Teacher",
      "location": "Nashville, TN",
      "dates": "Jun 2009 - Jun 2012",
      "description": "Who moved my cheese cheesy feet cauliflower cheese. Queso taleggio when the cheese comes out everybody's happy airedale ricotta cheese and wine paneer camembert de normandie.

    }
  ]
};

function locationizer(work_obj) {
    var locations = [];
    for (job in work.jobs) {
        var singleLocation = work["jobs"][job].location;
        locations.push(singleLocation);
    }
    return locations;
}

console.log(locationizer(work));

```

### International Name format

"Peter Chen" -> "Peter CHEN"

```JavaScript
function inName(name) {
    name = name.trim().split(" ");
    console.log(name);
    name[1] = name[1].toUpperCase();
    name[0] = name[0].slice(0,1).toUpperCase() +
              name[0].slice(1).toLowerCase();

    return name[0] + " " + name[1];
}
```

### JavaScript Anonymous functions

Anonymous functions are functions that don't have a name and are often returned
by other functions and objects. Example:

```JavaScript
$.getJSON("test.json", function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```
