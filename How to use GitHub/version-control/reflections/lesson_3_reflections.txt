Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	forks like copy the thing on the remote to your remote.
	clones can be performed from remote to local and local to local.

stored locally?

	You can have a point where when the merge happens it could be used as a anchor to
	resolve the data lose or the irreversible change.
