When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can share it with different people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might be some bugs and developer wants to push the 'clean' changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	forks like copy the thing on the remote to your remote.
	clones can be performed from remote to local and local to local.
	branch is the thing that exist in a certain project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	You can have a point where when the merge happens it could be used as a anchor to
	resolve the data lose or the irreversible change.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	Much more easier, who came up with this? He / She must be brilliant 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

	When I want to expore more features and more posibilities.
	
This just to test if I can pull this change to the local resiptory
