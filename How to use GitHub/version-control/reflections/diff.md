# Behavior of git diff

Consider the same partial git log output as in the previous exercise. Which arguments would you need to give the git diff command for the lines of code that implement the mute button to be marked as additions (with a plus sign)?

To make the options on the next screen easier to read, only the first 6 characters of each commit ID have been included. This will not change the output of git diff unless two commits start with the same 6 characters.
