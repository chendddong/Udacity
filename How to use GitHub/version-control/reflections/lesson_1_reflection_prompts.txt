How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It is easy to spot the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	You may delete a thing that you would regret for the rest of your life

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Save tons of your time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because it requires the respitory to change at the same time and it is a project


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Just use it, see the ids and compare them together

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can do it whenever possible. I'm not afraid to make any changes and I really
    find it useful

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to give it a try when every possible using the command line may be?
