# How do I Complete this Project?
Here's what you should do:

    1.  Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section to your lower right hand corner and review it.
    2.  Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
    3.  Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
    4.  Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
    5.  Validate your HTML and CSS against the [W3C's Validators](https://validator.w3.org/). Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:
    6.  HTML5: **Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta** when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
    7.  CSS3: **Property ***[some property here]*** is an unknown vendor extension** when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).
